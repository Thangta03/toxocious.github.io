Over the time that I’ve invested over the past number of years, I never really thought to document any of the processes that I’ve taken or have gone through.

“*Why would I do that?*”, I’ve asked myself many times.

That was until today, when I woke up and had an epiphany.

I woke up realizing that keeping a log of my thoughts and processes would serve as a truly exemplary history of what I’ve gone through, what I’ve learned throughout my time as a software engineer, and lastly to serve as a place to express my thoughts.

So from this point onwards, I’ll be documenting a vast majority of what I’m currently doing and investing my time into. If that seems like something of interest to you, then I hope that you stick around!

To list a few of these things:

- Talking about my largest personal project Pokémon Absolute which can be found here — go take a look if you like Pokémon!
- Documenting my process learning data structures and algorithms, even picking up and doing leetcode-style problems.
- Mentioning new frameworks, libraries, and whatnot that I find to be awesome and/or useful.
