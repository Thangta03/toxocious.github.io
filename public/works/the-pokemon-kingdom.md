## What Is The Pokemon Kingdom?
The Pokémon Kingdom is a up-to-date online Pokémon RPG with a wide variety of gameplay to offer. We have a widespread and active community of Pokémon fans, both new and old.



## My Roles & Contributions
I've been programming for The Pok&eacute;mon Kingdom since Q3 of 2018, and as the other primary developer of the website, I was to fix any reported bugs that were reported, as well as to expand upon existing features and implement new features from the ground up. I maintain constant and consistent interaction with the player-base as well.

All of this applies to both the current version of the game, the current "old-school" version of the game, and an old version of the game that has since been removed.



## Notable Bug Fixes & Contributions
- Maintained consistent interaction with the player-base
- Planned out and developed entire seasonal events from scratch &mdash; custom maps and questlines included
- Massively updated the battle system in OOP logic to allow for quicker battles with greatly enhanced server-side logic and readability
- Implemented an advanced Pickaxe system for the Mining feature, allowing for better upgrades, and unbreakable pickaxes
- Implemented various cronjobs for features of the game that depended on daily and weekly resets
- Implemented new items that allowed for hunting Ungendered and shiny Pok&eacute;mon much more easily
- Fixed a bug where upgrading an clan's stat didn't remove a specific currency
- Fixed a bug where account-locked Pok&eacute;mon were able to be sold and traded
- Fixed a bug where integers were getting parsed as strings and thus displaying as exponents
- Fixed a bug where a Pok&eacute;mon's stats in battle were being incorrectly calculated
