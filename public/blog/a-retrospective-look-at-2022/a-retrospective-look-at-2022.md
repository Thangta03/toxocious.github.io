description: Looking back at 2022 and going over new tech that came out, my experiences over the year, and more.

2022 was a year that came a myriad of exciting and promising new releases in the tech community, as well as some massive lay-offs by a number of companies.

Let's talk about it.

# Recession & Lay-offs

Unfortunately, throughout the latter half of 2022, many companies began to lay-off employees, some of which were very recent hires, and others that weren't. Even now, we're seeing some of the top companies lay off vast numbers of their employees, such as Amazon, Twitter, and Meta. My heart goes out to those who were laid off, especially as hiring surged to unseen levels during the first two years of COVID.

No one can be sure as to when the economy will come out of the recession that it's currently in, but I can only hope that the people who've been affected by it the most get through the foreseeable future.

# Exciting Releases

Numerous tools came out over the year, and while it's been difficult to check them all out, I'd love to talk about the three things that, out of what I checked out throughout the year, are my favorites.

## ChatGPT
By far, one of the tools that came out in 2022 with the largest uproar was ChatGPT, a ML model trained to respond to user-given prompts in a human-like way.

Whether you feed it some code and ask ChatGPT to fix it, write it in a different language, or even ask it to come up with code based on a set of requirements, it can do it. The answers given by ChatGPT may not always be correct, but it's been extremely useful in the development process for me, and I'm really looking forward to seeing the model get better at giving accurate answers and responses.

> You can learn more about ChatGPT [on the OpenAI blog](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), or you can check it out in real-time [here](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

## T3 Stack
We saw the release of the very popular T3 stack, bringing a nicely opinionated approach to end-to-end type-safety for applications that use TypeScript on both the back-end and front-end, ensuring that type-safety is not an option but rather a necessity during development. As someone who's used the T3 stack, it's been an outstanding experience, and even if you are someone who personally prefers a non-opinionated apprach to your tech stack, I would highly recommend trying out the T3 stack.

> T3 stack is open-source with over 12k stars on Github. Check out the [repository for it](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) and see what it's all about!

## Codux
Additionally, we saw the release of Codux, which was quite substantial. It redefines developing your application with React by providing you with an experience much like VS Code, but goes a step further in providing in-editor **live** React component modification. After coding a React component, you're not only able to preview it while in the Codux editor, but you may also make changes inside of the component preview and have those changes reflected live in your component's code. It is very promising, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it improves in 2023.

If you do a ton of development with React, give Codux an attempt shot and see if it fits your development environment.

> You can check the project out on [their official website](https://www.codux.com/), or you can check out their in-browser [demo](https://codux-demos.com/blueprint-css-webapp/?type=home).

## Take Away
Outside of my top three choices, a plethora of tools, both new and old, came out this year or saw extensive updates. Always keep an eye out for tools and the like that may help you during development; there's always something in the works, and you never know what could be great unless you try it.

I can't wait to see what everyone creates in 2023, and I'm absolutely looking forward to trying out some new tech.

# My 2022 Experiences

2022 was a pretty busy year for me; I even made this blog/portfolio site earlier this year!

- I took some time off to help some family pack-up and move.
- I invested around 100 to 200 hours finding software engineering job positions and applying for them.
  - Something something, upload your resume, but hey! Make sure you fill out all of this information that's already on the resume you uploaded!
- I spent a ton of time further learning and developing some side-projects, both for myself and for a small group of friends of mine.
- I spent some time learning data structures and algorithms.
  - I really need to pick these back up to get more familiar, though!

Discovering [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) on YouTube, and subsequently following him on social media, was a blessing for me. I've learned a lot by consuming his content, and have found other people through him that have not only encouraged me to grow, but that have provided content that let's me step out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it's been an absolutely fantastic experience so far. His content is amazing; he often goes over the topic at hand in an in-depth manner, weighing both the pros and cons of the hypothetical scenario, and will often go a step further and reasonable solutions.

I came across [ThePrimeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen) some time after I discovered Theo, and watching as he puts out content &mdash; through Twitch livestreams or YouTube videos &mdash; has been huge for me. The content that he puts out has a fun twist to it, is quite often **very** informative about things (such as when he does benchmarking of languages, for example), and I've learned an absolute ton from him. Honorable mention here, but he was kind enough to invest time in putting together a course on data structures and algorithms, hosted it live, and then made the entire course available for free on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/heap/). I checked it out, and he goes over these data structures and algorithms in ways that are very easy to understand. How phenomenal is that?

All of that being said, it wasn't the best year, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I've learned a lot over this past year, and while I'm not completely satisfied where I'm currently at, I am truly excited to see where I'll be at the end of 2023.
