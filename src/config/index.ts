  summary: [
    'I love programming and I have an avid interest in GNU/Linux as well as PHP, though I\'m always ready to use whatever is best for the job, especially if it means picking up new technology.',

    "Throughout my time as a freelance software engineer, I've learned numerous languages and skills and have efficiently adapted them to many different applications. I can quickly identify problems and come up with potential solutions to them that quickly resolve the issue and improve many aspects of the code base and user experience.",

    "PHP and TypeScript are my go-to languages, though I've used Python and some C++ as well. When building something new, or working in an existing code-base, I tend to favor the technologies that would best work for the task at hand, even if I don't prior experience with them.",
