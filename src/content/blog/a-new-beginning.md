description: I've spent a number of years developing personal projects and taking on freelance jobs, but I never thought to talk about the process that I've gone through to get here. Starting today, that all changes.

Over the time that I’ve invested over the past number of years, I never really thought to document any of the processes that I’ve taken or have gone through.

“*Why would I do that?*”, I’ve asked myself many times.

That was until today, when I woke up and had an epiphany.

I woke up realizing that keeping a log of my thoughts and processes would serve as a truly exemplary history of what I’ve gone through, what I’ve learned throughout my time as a software engineer, and lastly to serve as a place to express my thoughts.

So from this point onwards, I’ll be documenting a vast majority of what I’m currently doing and investing my time into. If that seems like something of interest to you, then I hope that you stick around!

To list a few of these things:

- Talking about my largest personal project Pokémon Absolute which can be found here — go take a look if you like Pokémon!
- Documenting my process learning data structures and algorithms, even picking up and doing leetcode-style problems.
- Mentioning new framejobs, libraries, and whatnot that I find to be awesome and/or useful.
