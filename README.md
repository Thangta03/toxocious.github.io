  <h1 align="center">My Personal Website</h1>

  A personal website is a pretty important thing to have as a software engineer, so I wanted to put something together that would match what I envision and want in a personal website &mdash; an outlet for me to describe myself and the things that I've worked on, while occasionally dumping my brain in a blog article or two.

  It comes with beautiful gradients, outstanding typography, mobile responsiveness, and a small personal touch with a nice Pokemon decal; what more could I possibly want?

  If you're interested in using this repository as a template, please consider forking it and leaving a star.

## Updating To Fit Your Information
I tried to keep page information as modular as I possibly could. Updating your name, occupation, etc. is as easy as opening the [dedicated config]() file and adjusting the information accordingly. This will handle almost everything for you, which is fantastic.

What it *doesn't* handle though, is the content on the *About* page, which is currently manually written. It's easy enough to update that stuff to your liking; just open the page in your editor of choice and go from there.

Updating your work history, open source contributions, and project list is extremely easy as well. Add a Markdown file into any one of the three `src/content` folders, add the frontmatter and content of the file, and it'll automatically be found and displayed on your website. Adding a blog article is just as easy, which is wonderful.
If you get confused on what your Markdown files should have, you can check out and use my existing files as a reference.
